# RecSys 

This repository contains information for the materials used in for London Flatiron Schools Reccomendation Systems Lecture.
Materials for this lecture is built off of work done by [Yish and her movie reccomendation system lecture](https://github.com/yishuen/meetup-movie-recommender) as well as work from the [Seattle campus](https://github.com/learn-co-students/recommendation_systems_seattle-ds).

## Learning Objectives 

After the lesson, students should be able to...

* [ ] Explain the advantages and disadvantages of personalised vs non-personalised reccomendation systems
* [ ] Explain what is the cold start problem in the world of RecSys
* [ ] Explain what a content based RecSys is 
* [ ] Explain why collaborative filtering is an effective way of giving personalised reccomendations
* [ ] Define what a utility matrix is in reference to RecSys
* [ ] Note what problems arise when trying to evaluate RecSys engines

## Additional Readings and Resources:

Yish has wrote a couple posts on Medium about recommendation engines: https://medium.com/@yishuen
- [A Primer to Recommendation Engines](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-primer-to-recommendation-engines-49bd12ed849f)
- [Collaborative Filtering on Utility Matrices](https://towardsdatascience.com/math-for-data-science-collaborative-filtering-on-utility-matrices-e62fa9badaab)

If you want to read more about the math behind SVD, check out Chapter 9. We highly *recommend* it if you want to understand how SVD works using gradient descent + alternating least squares.
